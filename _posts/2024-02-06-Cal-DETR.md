[NeurIPS 2023](https://nips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/72856), 2024-02-06 기준 0회 인용

## Task
- Object Detection
- DETR
- Caalibration

## Contribution
- Safety-critical applications 에 Deep neural networks (DNN) 를 적용 및 활용하는데 있어 제한을 갖고 있다
> a deployed model could be exposed to constantly changing distributions which could be radically different from its training distribution.
- Proposing a mechanism for calibrated detection transformers (Cal-DETR)
- Uncertainty-guided logit modulation mechanism 제안
- Logit mixing approach 제안


## Proposed Method

### Measuring Calibration

### Cal-DETR: Uncertainty-Guided Logit Modulation & Mixing

#### Uncertainty-Guided Logit Modulation

#### Logit Mixing for Confidence Calibration


## Experimental Results
